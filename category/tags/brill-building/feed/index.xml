interview by Don Charles</p>
<p>&#8220;Some songs, like &#8216;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&#8217; people hear and they get sad.  I think I&#8217;d rather have them get happy!  That&#8217;s really where I was coming from.&#8221;  That&#8217;s how songwriter/producer extraordinaire Jeff Barry sums up his musical philosophy, a philosophy that moved millions of dollars&#8217; worth of vinyl around the world during the 1960s.  Jeff Barry was the crown king of bubble gum rock producers (only Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz&#8217; A &#038; R staff came close to challenging his dominance of the genre).</p>
<p>Jeff Barry:  I was born in Brooklyn.  When I was about seven, my parents got divorced, and I moved in with my mom and sister in Plainfield, New Jersey.  I lived there until I was eleven, and then we moved back to Brooklyn.  For some reason, I was hearing a lot of country music.  As long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve always loved horses, and probably without realizing it, I liked listening to country and western music because that went along with horses!</p>
<p>Don Charles:  My research indicates that your family name was Adelberg . . . </p>
<p>Jeff Barry:  Yes, that</p>
