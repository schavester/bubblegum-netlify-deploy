<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; BUBBLEGUM ALBUMS</p>
<p>(in the strictly Long-playing, Long-lasting, but pretty well <em>long</em> out-of-print category)</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="http://www.kingofhits.co.uk/"><strong>JONATHAN KING</strong></a>&nbsp; <em>Bubble Rock Is Here To Stay</em>&nbsp; (U.K. Records, 1972)</p>
<p>Including witfully-wadded takes on anything and everything from &ldquo;Satisfaction&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mr. Tambourine Man&rdquo; to &ldquo;Rock Around The Clock&rdquo; and beyond, this truly is the world&rsquo;s tartiest collection of, as Mr. King describes it himself, &ldquo;fabulous old wines in beautiful new bottles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Various Artistes&nbsp; <a target="_self" href="http://rateyourmusic.com/album_images/s326798.jpg"><strong><em>The Fabulous Bubblegum Years</em></strong></a>&nbsp; (Kory Records, 1976)</p>
<p>Fifteen (&ldquo;count &lsquo;em!&rdquo;) of K&amp;K&rsquo;s gooiest &lsquo;n&rsquo; gummiest of all, expertly sequenced and lovingly packaged by the good folks at &#8212; <em>who?</em> &#8212; Kory.&nbsp; This, along with that first Ramone album, surely made 1976 the year of Bubblegum&rsquo;s last great (original) gasp.</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="http://balefire.tripod.com/articles.html"><strong>BUTTERSCOTT</strong></a>&nbsp; <em>Great Scott</em>&nbsp; (Grapefruit Records, 1998)</p>
<p>The proudly self-confessed Bubblegum Man of Boston herein gathers together an hour of his greatest three-chord, four-track creations and offers them boldly to a world which, long ago it seems, seems to have all but forgotten the simple joys in rhyming &ldquo;yummy&rdquo; with &ldquo;tummy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a target="_self" href="http://www.myspace.com/candypants"><strong>CANDYPANTS</strong></a>&nbsp; <em>Candypants</em>&nbsp; (Sympathy For The Record Industry, 2000)</p>
<p>What do you get when you toss together a wad of Los Angeles&rsquo; greatest unsung musicians to create a clutch of tunes that veer wildly between pop-a-billy sass, Ronettes mascara-raunch, and the attraction(s) that was very early Elvis Costello?&nbsp; Top it all with the provocatively crayola-tones of the one and only Lisa Jenio and you honestly have one of the gummily-greatest creations this side of Josie and her Puddytats.&nbsp; Brings ALL new meanings to the expression &ldquo;pony up&rdquo; (for starters).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bubblegum is the story of songwriter-producers&mdash;makers of shiny sounds.&nbsp; The villains in many rock legends, these are people who saved their innocence for their musical sentiments and never did anything so stupid as to sign away their publishing.&nbsp; Firing inept drummers, replacing lead singers, they ruthlessly worked the system to make it pop.&nbsp; But here we also find gentle studio geeks with a genius for engineering, child prodigies, cheerful tunesmiths in love with the game, the insane pace, the charts. </p>
<p> We&rsquo;re conscious of legendary recording sessions with Phil Spector and Brian Wilson, George Martin facilitating Sgt. Pepper, Aretha&rsquo;s first epochal piano chord in Memphis or Hendrix pulling together layers of sonic strata on Electric Ladyland.&nbsp; Still, our sense of the studio&rsquo;s place in Rock Mythology remains peripheral.&nbsp; Only serious music fans know the names James Jamerson or Hal Blaine, while even the most casual listener knows their work.&nbsp; Bubblegum, like Disco, like Motown, like much of Nashville today, exists primarily within a studio culture of session players and songwriter-producers.&nbsp; This particular hyphenate ought to be better known than singer-songwriters&mdash;it&rsquo;s the economic trigger for the whole recording industry.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because both songwriters and producers collect royalties, and if you double up your credits on a hit record you&rsquo;re raking in some serious chump change. &nbsp;</p>
<p> Reading these interviews we&rsquo;re struck by the canniness and audacity of non-writers Kasenetz and Katz piggybacking bizarre studio goofs onto the b-sides of sure hits to collect songwriting checks.&nbsp; Or Jonathan King&rsquo;s shameless talent for converting fads into pop hits.&nbsp; But we also delight in Jeff Barry building up the drum track for &ldquo;Be My Baby&rdquo; one mallet tap at a time, or Mike Batt living in a Womble suit for a week before setting those characters in song.</p>
<p> Here you find tricksters and hipsters, songwriters and songbirds, studio tans and golden ears.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> West Coast Pop anticipated bubblegum&rsquo;s methods, blurred the lines between music for sale and music that sells, influenced the sound of bubblegum and provided the pool of creators that presided over its cartooniest era.</p>
<p> As the man who squeezed Brian Wilson&rsquo;s vision into an LP&rsquo;s worth of slot-car racing songs and gave voice to Big Daddy Roth&rsquo;s model kits, Gary Usher&rsquo;s influence can&rsquo;t be overstated.&nbsp; Bubblegum&rsquo;s splendid tradition of completely fictitious bands starts at the Brill Building, but achieves a cheesy genius in the Weird-Ohs, the Super Stocks, the Hondells, and the Revells.&nbsp; Though his busiest period predates bubblegum&rsquo;s onset by several years, Gary Usher laid out the entire bubblegum blueprint before it had a name.&nbsp; He recorded musically and lyrically upbeat music with a steady core of studio musicians under a variety of ghost band names, commissioned for a visual medium (substitute Beach Movies for TV here).&nbsp; Whereas most bubblegum makers went into commercial jingles after their bubblegum careers, Usher brazenly turned a Honda promotion into a masterstroke of pop genius (&ldquo;Little Honda&rdquo;).</p>
<p> Gary Zekley perfectly encapsulates the West Coast studio scene, swallowing not-so-disparate sub-genres like surf, sunshine pop, bubblegum and psych pop in one gulp.&nbsp; Most of his East Coast peers simply considered themselves pop songwriters with little concern for marketing categories.&nbsp; Zekley&rsquo;s fluid career cautions against leaning too heavily on genre distinctions.&nbsp; You can assign the Fun and Games, Yellow Balloon and the Clique to different bins, but the same talent clearly penned &ldquo;The Grooviest Girl in the World,&rdquo; &ldquo;How Can I Be Down&rdquo; and &ldquo;Superman.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Oftentimes the supporting players provide a better window into a scene than the big names.&nbsp; Carol Connors found a niche in the L.A. scene, fronting Beach Bunny bands for Gary Usher and co-writing some tunes.&nbsp; Carol&rsquo;s &ldquo;Yum Yum Yamaha&rdquo; does more to clarify the seamless fusion of surf, bubblegum and commercial jingles that defined west coast pop than any five books about the Beach Boys.</p>
