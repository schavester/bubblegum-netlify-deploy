										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi. In 1970, after his phenomenal success with The Monkees and The Archies via television, Don Kirshner set his sights on the motion picture industry to launch his latest bubblegum band. &quot;Toomorrow&quot; was a movie, a band, an album, two singles&#8230;and a flop! Kirshner recruited a 21-year-old Australian singer and actress named Olivia Newton-John to front the band, which also included Vic Cooper, Ben Thomas, and Karl Chambers. The plot is pretty wild. A space center called Alphoid Galactic Control has assigned an alien (played by John Williams) to observe Earthlings in search of a cure for &quot;the sterility of sound in space.&quot; When he hears the music of Toomorrow, he kidnaps the band and their positive sounds and whisks them into outer space to save the day. I actually think it&#8217;s pretty groovy. The film bombed, but has since become a cult classic. The music is pretty good pop in my opinion. Despite the project&#8217;s failure, the sun is going to shine&#8230;toomorrow! I&#8217;m sharing mp3&#8217;s of the music at my blog, <a href="http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/">http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Check it out!</p>
