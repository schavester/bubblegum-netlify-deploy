<p>&#8220;There is no Crazy Elephant,&#8221; insists writer-producer Ritchie Cordell.  &#8220;That was just Bob Spencer.&#8221;  Robert Spencer was a member of the Cadillacs, who recorded the rock and roll classic &#8220;Speedo,&#8221; a #14 hit from 1955.  In the years that followed, Spencer kept active in the industry, often penning songs and selling them off without just compensation, according to Cordell.  In 1969, Spencer linked up with Kasenetz &#038; Katz just as their Super K bubblegum machine was churning out the hits full-throttle.</p>
<p>Kasenetz &#038; Katz hooked him up with Cordell and Joey Levine, who together had penned the soulful &#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin&#8217;.&#8221;  The searing single, featuring Spencer&#8217;s scorching lead vocal and an obvious background vocal assist by Levine, was submitted to Buddah Records, the New York-based label with whom Kasenetz &#038; Katz had been so continually successful.  &#8220;We played it for [Buddah General Manager] Neil Bogart,&#8221; the Super K boys recall, &#8220;but he said, &#8216;No, I don&#8217;t hear it.'&#8221;  Undeterred, they walked Crazy Elephant over to Larry Uttal at neighboring Bell Records, who snapped it up.  By May 1969, &#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'&#8221; hit #12 in Billboard.  Its stateside success prompted a British release, where it also peaked at #12.</p>
<p>Kasenetz &#038; Katz recruited a five-piece band of college-age youths to support the single on the road, pose for pictures, and fill out the inevitable album.  According to the credits on that sole self-titled LP, the lucky winners of this strange sweepstakes were Larry Laufer (leader, keyboards and vocals), Ronnie Bretone (bass), Bob Avery (drums), Kenny Cohen (flute, sax, and vocals) and Hal King (vocals).  The whole process was standard operating procedure for bubblegummeisters Kasenetz and Katz.  More often than not, according to Cordell, they would &#8220;send five bands [with the same name] out on the road.  They&#8217;d stick them in a room with the album and have them learn all the songs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'&#8221; was the only Crazy Elephant record for Cordell and Levine.  When the Spencer-soundalike follow-ups &#8220;Sunshine, Red Wine&#8221; and &#8220;Gimme Some More&#8221; failed to click, Kasenetz &#038; Katz took Crazy Elephant in a new direction</p>
