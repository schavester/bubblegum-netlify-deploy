<p>&#8220;There is no Crazy Elephant,&#8221; insists writer-producer Ritchie Cordell.  &#8220;That was just Bob Spencer.&#8221;  Robert Spencer was a member of the Cadillacs, who recorded the rock and roll classic &#8220;Speedo,&#8221; a #14 hit from 1955.  In the years that followed, Spencer kept active in the industry, often penning songs and selling them off without just compensation, according to Cordell.  In 1969, Spencer linked up with Kasenetz &#038; Katz just as their Super K bubblegum machine was churning out the hits full-throttle.</p>
<p>Kasenetz &#038; Katz hooked him up with Cordell and Joey Levine, who together had penned the soulful &#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin&#8217;.&#8221;  The searing single, featuring Spencer&#8217;s scorching lead vocal and an obvious background vocal assist by Levine, was submitted to Buddah Records, the New York-based label with whom Kasenetz &#038; Katz had been so continually successful.  &#8220;We played it for [Buddah General Manager] Neil Bogart,&#8221; the Super K boys recall, &#8220;but he said, &#8216;No, I don&#8217;t hear it.'&#8221;  Undeterred, they walked Crazy Elephant over to Larry Uttal at neighboring Bell Records, who snapped it up.  By May 1969, &#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'&#8221; hit #12 in Billboard.  Its stateside success prompted a British release, where it also peaked at #12.</p>
<p>Kasenetz &#038; Katz recruited a five-piece band of college-age youths to support the single on the road, pose for pictures, and fill out the inevitable album.  According to the credits on that sole self-titled LP, the lucky winners of this strange sweepstakes were Larry Laufer (leader, keyboards and vocals), Ronnie Bretone (bass), Bob Avery (drums), Kenny Cohen (flute, sax, and vocals) and Hal King (vocals).  The whole process was standard operating procedure for bubblegummeisters Kasenetz and Katz.  More often than not, according to Cordell, they would &#8220;send five bands [with the same name] out on the road.  They&#8217;d stick them in a room with the album and have them learn all the songs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'&#8221; was the only Crazy Elephant record for Cordell and Levine.  When the Spencer-soundalike follow-ups &#8220;Sunshine, Red Wine&#8221; and &#8220;Gimme Some More&#8221; failed to click, Kasenetz &#038; Katz took Crazy Elephant in a new direction</p>

by Bill Pitzonka</p>
<p>Early in 1969, a corporate summit occurred between limited-cel animation kingpins Hanna-Barbera and bubblegum cottage industrialists Kasenetz-Katz.  Though seemingly a marriage made in marketing heaven, negotiations ultimately broke down between the two notoriously control-conscious purveyors of prepubescent product, but not before one semi-official act of business could be completed.  Ritchie Cordell, who had recently joined the stable of Kasenetz-Katz Associates after a string of huge hits with Tommy James &#038; the Shondells, was commissioned to create the theme for Captain Groovy And His Bubblegum Army.  Cordell co-wrote the song with &#8220;1, 2, 3, Red Light&#8221; tunesmith Sal Trimachi, based on Kasenetz &#038; Katz&#8217;s original concept.  Cordell recalls that the lead vocal on the single was &#8220;Bobby Bloom sped up [on tape],&#8221; eerily replicating the nasal vocal stylings of Joey Levine, who had recently parted company with Kasenetz &#038; Katz to found his own Earth and L&#038;R labels with Artie Resnick.  In the way that all things come full circle, L&#038;R scored their biggest hit in 1970 with Bobby Bloom&#8217;s &#8220;Montego Bay.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kasenetz &#038; Katz, meanwhile, had been given their own Super K imprint through Buddah Records.  As one of their very first releases, they issued the rather dark Captain Groovy theme song (&#8220;Captain Groovy and his Bubblegum Army are coming to take you away,&#8221; as the lyric so ominously intoned).  Despite the fact that the cartoon series never made it past the drawing board, a poster of the actual characters exists somewhere in the Super K offices.  Without the series, the sole offering under the Captain Groovy banner managed to bubble under the Billboard Hot 100 for a few weeks, peaking at #127.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Informal History of Bubblegum Music<br />
by Carl Cafarelli</p>
<p>&#8220;When Buddah Records was formed two years ago, most songs were about crime and war and depression.  At the time we felt there was a place for a new kind of music that would make people feel happy.  So we got together with two talented young producers named Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz who had an idea for music that would make you smile.  It was called &#8216;bubblegum music.'&#8221;<br />
The above quote, taken from the liner notes to a circa-l969 sampler LP called Buddah&#8217;s 360 Degree Dial-A-Hit, gives us both a succinct statement of intent for the critically reviled &#8217;60s pop music phenomenon called bubblegum and an equally-succinct recap of the genre&#8217;s origin.  </p>
<p>Although bubblegum has gained a certain cachet of cool in some circles over the past few decades (while remaining a pop pariah in other circles), during its original heyday it was viewed strictly as fodder for juvenile tastes, pure pabulum for pre-teen people.  Furthermore, the music was blatantly commercial at a time when such materialistic goals were deemed unacceptable by an emerging counterculture.  Bubblegum music held no delusions of grandeur, nor any intent to expand your mind or alter your perceptions.  Bubblegum producers only wanted you to fork over the dough and go home to play your new acquisition over and over to your heart&#8217;s content (and, no doubt, to your older brother&#8217;s consternation).  </p>
<p>Bubblegum is absolved of any perceived counter-revolutionary sentiments because it was so damn catchy.  Once </p>
