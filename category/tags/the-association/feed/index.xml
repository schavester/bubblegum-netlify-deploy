										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sunshine Pop <br /> by Chris Davidson</p>
<p> What can sunshine pop hope to prove in this evil, angry world?&nbsp; Sunshine pop&mdash;the effervescent song of rampant happiness.&nbsp; A thousand hummingbirds grooving to newly discovered nectar.&nbsp; The virginal essence of pop, wispy and white and skimmed off a cool vanilla milkshake to be infused with gleeful melody.&nbsp; The together timbre of the Association, the pleasing gum-snap of the Yellow Balloon, or&mdash;most perfectly&mdash;the dazzling choral layercake of the Cowsills.&nbsp; What chance do these sun-drenched sounds have with us moderns?</p>
<p> Those with the faintest longing for purity know well the uplifting&mdash;nay the inspiring&mdash;power of this music.&nbsp; At its most blinding it matches bubblegum&rsquo;s oomph note for note.&nbsp; But not for sunshine pop the sexual subtext or nasal bleating: where bubblegum says, &ldquo;I got love in my tummy,&rdquo; s-pop exclaims:&nbsp; &ldquo;I love the flower girl.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fine line, to be sure.&nbsp; Over here one type of joyful noise, over there another.&nbsp; But darn it if sunshine pop isn&rsquo;t its own cheerful potpourri of twirling, exuberant arrangements and over-the-bra lovey-doveyness.&nbsp; Baroque pop, you ask?&nbsp; Not really, although the harpsichord features prominently at times, and an Old World flavor definitely pervades.&nbsp; Folk rock, then?&nbsp; Not quite, despite an acoustic drop cloth on which everything eventually lands.&nbsp; The balance is precarious.&nbsp; The peel of a harmonica or improper throaty vocal will snatch an otherwise frisky sunshine tune from your grasp and deposit it back into the standard 1960s pop camp.</p>
<p> Sunshine pop had a fling with the best-seller crowd in the mid-&rsquo;60s&mdash;or, more correctly, light harmony pop did, for its lush harmonies and wistful themes approached but did not capture the oblique and melancholy X Factor of sunshine pop.&nbsp; Radio staples like &ldquo;Younger Girl&rdquo; and &ldquo;Love (Can Make You Happy)&rdquo; came close.&nbsp; Reams of sublime examples ducked beneath the charts.&nbsp; Bubbling under, the likes of the Sunshine Company&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Just Want To Be Your Friend&rdquo; the well documented &ldquo;The Grooviest Girl In The World&rdquo; and &ldquo;California My Way&rdquo; by the Committee turned us gay with AM delight.</p>
<p> Some b-gum stars straddled both camps&mdash;the Archies&rsquo; &ldquo;Sugar and Spice&rdquo; is sun-baked like Dennis Wilson&rsquo;s split ends.&nbsp; But sunshine pop is best discovered in the margins of bubblegum where the acknowledged luminaries took a backseat to a simplified (and remarkably moving) emotional milieu, an endless series of first dates and the blinding optimism of youth.&nbsp; Hit and flop alike, speak softly, and behold sunshine pop&rsquo;s gentle-hearted best and brightest:</p>
<p> The Beach Boys <br /> Traced directly to these rapturous lads, the roots of sunshine pop reside not so much with the overplayed hits as with certain pre-Pet Sounds album cuts.&nbsp; The trick is the rich B. Wilson production, which piles high the harmonies&mdash;a central facet and key differentiator between straight surf vocal disks and the true sunny stuff.&nbsp; Sunshine pop is, after all, less about summer rock-and-roll and more about the evocation of summer shadiness, a delicate point.&nbsp; A thousand harmony-laden masterpieces owe patent infringement damages to &ldquo;In the Parking Lot&rdquo; and especially &ldquo;Let Him Run Wild.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Association<br /> Too freshman-year earnest after their first hits to qualify as mainstays of the movement, the Association delivered a superb first album&mdash;And Then Along Comes The Association&mdash;overseen by producer Curt Boettcher and featuring tight bursts of harmony pop shrapnel.&nbsp; Forgive the facial hair for their still-thrilling &ldquo;Along Comes Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p> The Cowsills<br /> Optimism rock&mdash;family division.&nbsp; The vociferous Cowsill brood galvanized Rhode Island with the most gleaming pipes of all, a team of precision instruments tightly wound like a teenage Magnificent Seven.&nbsp; After a few flop singles, the tribe exploded with towering, sun-basted material: &ldquo;The Rain, The Park And Other Things&rdquo; &ldquo;Gray, Sunny Day&rdquo; &ldquo;We Can Fly&rdquo; and, most euphoric of all, &ldquo;All My Days&rdquo; part of a Cowsills EP sponsored by the American Dairy Association (fully one-sixth of tiny R.I.&rsquo;s milk supply is suspected to have been consumed by a Cowsill).</p>
<p> The Bee Gees<br /> Happy in spurts amidst ever-present (but very welcome) pensiveness, the Bee Gees mastered the pop form while still teens.&nbsp; The early Australian recordings point skyward while simultaneously staring down and come extremely close to sunshine pop without fully capitulating.&nbsp; Still, brothers in lock-step harmony singing about butterflies says include them with an asterisk.&nbsp; Said &ldquo;Butterfly&rdquo; is a good place to begin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Cherry Red&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spicks and Specks&rdquo; receive extra points for overcoming the Euro-sunshine curse, as relatively few overseas pals convincingly linked up with this sound (is it even possible to be truly happy outside of the U.S.?).&nbsp; Yes, the Hollies came a breadth away with &ldquo;Everything Is Sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p> Yellow Balloon<br /> Gary Zekley, SoCal insider and one of many budding maestros orbiting the Wilson camp mid-decade, found chart fame producing the Clique&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sugar On Sunday&rdquo; and writing hits for the Grass Roots.&nbsp; Of his earlier work, this delicious &lsquo;67 album typifies the airy and upbeat mini-Spector density found on the most atmospheric s-pop.&nbsp; The Yellow B.&rsquo;s self-titled theme song was also cut by a Jan-less Jan and Dean on the lost, but since rediscovered, Save For A Rainy Day LP.&nbsp; No better full-length specimens of sunshine pop exist.</p>
<p> The Ballroom / Sagittarius / Millennium<br /> Surfacing soon after his association with the &ldquo;Along Comes Mary&rdquo; crew, Curt Boettcher launched a harmony steamship with a trio of worthy vessels.&nbsp; In quick succession, the Ballroom gave way to the Gary Usher-led Sagittarius which sired the stud-filled Millennium.&nbsp; The constant?&nbsp; Boettcher&rsquo;s ability to wrest symphonic miracles on cut after cut of California vapor-pop.</p>
<p> The Vision<br /> &ldquo;Small Town Commotion&rdquo; b/w &ldquo;Keepin&rsquo; Your Eyes On The Sun&rdquo; (UNI).&nbsp; Top side, a complex weaving tale of a fiery municipal disaster.&nbsp; The flip provides a luscious Gary Zekley artifact (produced under the nom du rock Yodar Critch), a perfectly realized distillation of July using girl backup, harps and a driving beat.&nbsp; Zeke&rsquo;s command: walk with me awhile and smile.</p>
<p> Wind<br /> &ldquo;Make Believe&rdquo; b/w &ldquo;Groovin&rsquo; With Mr. Bloe&rdquo; (Life).&nbsp; Uplifting melodious bubblegum masquerading as a 4 Seasons-like beat ballad.&nbsp; Joey Levine involvement.&nbsp; Slice off the harmful instrumental flip side, and a sun is born.</p>
<p> The Pleasure Fair<br /> &ldquo;Morning Glory Days&rdquo; b/w &ldquo;Fade In Fade Out&rdquo; (UNI).&nbsp; Add one more entry to David Gates&rsquo; long cool-guy resume.&nbsp; Gee-whiz harmony with light orchestral fanfare, like a very white Fifth Dimension (perhaps the Fourth Dimension in disguise).</p>
<p> Hyle King Movement<br /> &ldquo;Flower Smile&rdquo; b/w &ldquo;Forever &lsquo;N Ever&rdquo; (Liberty).&nbsp; Atmospheric swirl akin to Sergio Mendes harmonizing in a hot-house garden&mdash;plus decidedly hippie sentiments told in a deliciously un-hippie manner.</p>
