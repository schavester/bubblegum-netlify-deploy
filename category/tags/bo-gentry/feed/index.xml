<p> Not to be confused with the similarly-titled BMG collection for which I wrote the notes in 2001 (see below). If you&#8217;re seeking the most of this splendid bubblegum band you&#8217;ll need to pick up both discs, as there are six songs on the earlier release not on this mainly singles selection, among them the essential &quot;1910 Cotton Candy Castle.&quot; But if only one Fruitgum comp is in your future, it&#8217;d be hard to compete with this 28-track behemoth. I wish BMG had been as ambitious with their own vault artists as Germany&#8217;s Repertoire label! You&#8217;d have to dig through a lot of scuffy vinyl to assemble a comparable analog collection spanning the short, delicious career of this most infantile of semi-imaginary Buddah combos. Kicking off with the schoolyard earworm hits (including &quot;Simon Says,&quot; &quot;Indian Giver&quot; and &quot;1-2-3 Red Light&quot;), the disc also spotlights the band (or its studio doppelgangers) in its jazzy, psychedelic and garagey manifestations. The b-sides are highlights (and a rare chance to enjoy band-penned compositions), like the growling bad girl raver &quot;No Good Annie,&quot; and the Chinese psych-out &quot;Reflections from the Looking Glass.&quot; Equally great are the retarded (in a good way) &quot;Sticky Sticky&quot; and the Link-Wray-in-orbit stylings of &quot;Baby Bret.&quot; The comp closes with several scarce Italian-language tracks, from the Fruitgums&#8217; late, barely-noticed Continental phase, including the exquisitely spooky &quot;C&#8217;e Qualcosa Che Non Picardo Piu.&quot; The booklet includes notes from John Tracy and a selection of colorful 45 sleeves, sheet music covers and oddities.</p>

THE 1910 FRUITGUM CO. by Kim Cooper</p>
<p>A thick pink strain of bubblegum music came oozing out of the world&#8217;s AM radios between 1967 and 1969, giving little kids something to pound their Mickey Mouse spoons about, and making critics groan. If you followed it back to the source you&#8217;d find New York City, and the studios rented by independent producers Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz. Under their supervision a revolving crew of bands, session players and writers knocked out giddy pop songs that mixed garage band riffs and nursery school rhyme schemes with deliciously catchy results.</p>
<p>By late 1967, Kasenetz and Katz were anxiously seeking hitmaking bands that could be paired up with writers in their Super K Productions stable. They&#8217;d already mined the teen clubs of central Ohio to come up with the Music Explosion, Ohio Express (originally Sir Timothy &#038; the Royals) and Lemon Pipers (Ivan &#038; the Sabres), but their next discovery would be found much closer to home.</p>
<p>Supposedly Jeff Katz&#8217; dad met several members of Jeckell &#038; the Hydes (previously known as the Lower Road, and the Odyssey) in a Linden, New Jersey diner, and passed their number along to his son; later, the producers heard them play at a house party. Kasenetz and Katz flipped over Mark Gutkowski&#8217;s boyish voice, and quickly signed the band to a production contract. With a little work, they&#8217;d become the third act in the mega-selling Buddah bubblegum triumvirate that included the Ohio Express and Lemon Pipers.</p>
<p>Of course that retro garage band name had to go, and &#8220;1910 Fruitgum Co.&#8221; fit right in with the other sugary Kasenetz and Katz confections. PR legend has it that rhythm guitarist Jeckell named the Fruitgums from an old gum wrapper found either in a suit pocket or an attic trunk (possibly both).</p>
<p>The 1910 Fruitgum Co. had their first hit with the immortal &#8220;Simon Says,&#8221; a song K&#038;K had been trying to place for some time. The kindergarten game lyrics set to a chugging garage rock organ riff set the stage for much of their future activity. They quickly established themselves as the most childlike of the bubblegum bands, their singles filled with babyish games and infantile alliteration. Album tracks revealed more adult themes, sometimes disturbingly fused with references to a loved one&#8217;s yummy candy sweetness. With these guys, you never knew if they were about to kiss a girl or take a bite!</p>
<p>But even the singles were more suggestive than they appeared on first glance. The lyrics of &#8220;1-2-3 Red Light&#8221; are less a schoolyard game than the sound of a boy wearing down his sweetie&#8217;s resistance through constant begging, with the threat of a break up if she doesn&#8217;t put out.</p>
<p>Every time I try to prove my love<br />
1-2-3 Red Light, you stop me&#8230;<br />
If you stop me again<br />
That&#8217;s when we might end<br />
So please don&#8217;t refuse</p>
<p>And in the sorta-psychedelic &#8220;1910 Cotton Candy Castle,&#8221; the promise of candy seems to carry a distinctly phallic subtext when Mark croons: &#8220;Here comes the Lollipop Man in his goody ship Lollipop/ all aboard for lollipop land where the lovin&#8217; never stops.&#8221;</p>
<p>For their first few (most bubblegummy) albums, the 1910 Fruitgum Co. was officially made up of the old Jeckell &#038; the Hydes lineup. This was Mark Gutkowski (vocals/ organ), Frank Jeckell (vocals/ rhythm guitar), Floyd Marcus (vocals/ drums), Steve Mortkowitz (bass) and Pat Karwan (vocals/ lead guitar). But sidemen were always being called in to play on K&#038;K productions, and there&#8217;s some controversy about who played on what. An intermediate lineup was Gutkowski with Chuck Travis (vocals/ lead guitar), Larry Ripley (vocals/ bass/ horn), Bruce Shay (vocals/ percussion), and Rusty Oppenheimer (vocals/ drums). Less than two years on, the hard rocking Hard Ride was the work of Jimmy Casazza (vocals/ drums/ percussion), Ralph Cohen (trumpet), Jerry Roth (vocals/ sax/ clarinet/ flute), Don Christopher (vocals/ guitar), Richie Gomez (vocals/ guitar) and Pat Soriano (vocals/ organ/ piano). Since K&#038;K owned the band name, anyone they wanted could &#8220;be&#8221; the 1910 Fruitgum Co.</p>
<p>Mark Gutkowski&#8217;s singing was the constant on most things released under the 1910 Fruitgum Co. name, but their #5 hit &#8220;1, 2, 3 Red Light&#8221; was supposedly Gutkowski backed by Vinnie Poncia, Pete Anders and guys from the touring version of session group the Tradewinds (&#8220;New York&#8217;s a Lonely Town&#8221;)-while other sources claim that Gutkowski wasn&#8217;t present at all, and the vocals for this song and &#8220;Goody Goody Gumdrops&#8221; were by &#8220;Gumdrops&#8221; co-writer Billy Carl.</p>
<p>Personnel matters aside, whoever the 1910 Fruitgum Co. were, they made monster bubblegum records throughout their short career, and the kids loved them. A vintage press release offers the tantalizing claim that their fans threw so much bubblegum (chewed and otherwise) during performances, that a little man had to sweep it up after every show. We also learn a thing or two about the original band members. Frank Jeckell (21) is the oldest, and the one who makes sure the others behave. He digs country music and golf. Pat Karwan (19) surfs, hates diets and airplanes, and chews a lot of gum. He sometimes uses the pen name Scaramuche Quackenbush. Mark Gutkowski (18) likes girls, steak and onions and sheepskin rugs, and hates barbershops and oatmeal. Steve Martkowitz (19) studied art in Paris, and is the silent type. Floyd Marcus (19) is always late, wants to be a great songwriter, hates shredded coconut and likes girls and sports car racing. Such nice boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;Indian Giver,&#8221; recorded with the middle Fruitgum lineup, proved to be the final Top 10 bubblegum smash for Buddah, first charting in January 1969. The song gives no sign that the power of bubblegum music was diminishing, and that hypnotic tom-tom beat can still stir the blood of tykes and their elders to this day. Master gumsters Bobby Bloom, Bo Gentry and Ritchie Cordell wrote this politically insensitive gem, while Bloom and Gentry wrote the Fruitgum&#8217;s final charting hit, &#8220;Special Delivery,&#8221; and produced both with Cordell.</p>
<p>Like most fads, bubblegum faded out after two years, but the Fruitgum Co. wasn&#8217;t quite ready to call it quits. Kasenetz and Katz gleefully told Roctober magazine&#8217;s James Porter that the final version of the band nearly got a plum gig at the Fillmore East, a hall far too hip to stoop to booking has-been bubblegummers. But an unlabeled test pressing of the heavier Hard Ride album impressed a booker sufficiently that a show was briefly offered, then immediately retracted when the ruse was revealed.</p>
<p>With that, the 1910 Fruitgum Co. retired, never to be seen again.</p>
<p>Thanks to Carl Cafarelli, Bill Holmes and James Porter.</p>
