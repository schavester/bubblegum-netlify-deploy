										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi. It&#8217;s an honor to be enrolled in Kim Cooper and David Smay&#8217;s Bubblegum University. Their Bubblegum Book was a huge influence on me in starting my own blog, MONDO DADDYKIN. I have collected bubblegum records for years, and their book, along with blogs like Bubblegum Fink, has inspired me to share a lot of these albums with you on MONDO DADDYKIN. While my blog consists of many elements like TV soundtracks and kiddie records to name a couple, my initial focus is the records made by TV-inspired bubblegum groups like The Archies, Josie and the Pussycats, Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids, and many others you may remember. My nickname is The Daddykin (after Veronica Lodge&#8217;s father, &quot;Daddykins&quot;!). Mondo Daddykin means &quot;all things daddykin,&quot; referring to my posts which all had some kind of impact on me in my&nbsp;record collecting journey. My following posts will give you an idea of the bubblegum stuff you&#8217;ll find at my blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/">http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/</a>&nbsp; Kim, thank you very much for the invitation.&nbsp; It is truly an honor to be here! </p>
