<p>This press release just in:</p>
<p> <strong>ANDY KIM, CO-WRITER OF &ldquo;SUGAR SUGAR,&rdquo; IS SWEET ON COLLECTORS&rsquo; CHOICE MUSIC<br /> &nbsp;<br /> </strong><strong>Four albums by last of the Brill Building artists (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F2C8E4/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank"><em>How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way/Rainbow Ride</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F2C8EE/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank"><em>Baby I Love You/Andy Kim</em></a>) to be reissued on two CDs on July 18<br /> </strong> <br /> LOS ANGELES, Calif. &mdash; Andy Kim has sold millions of records, but most people are under the impression he sold mere hundreds of thousands. The reason is simple. Although Kim had many hits under his own name (&ldquo;How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baby I Love You,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock Me Gently&rdquo; and &ldquo;So Good Together,&rdquo; to name a few), he co-wrote (with Jeff Barry) the Archies&rsquo; mega-hit &ldquo;Sugar Sugar,&rdquo; which sold 6 million 45 RPM units. Ron Dante provided the magic voice. Yet the fans never saw the scaffolding behind the scenes. The Archies, after all, consisted of Archie, Jughead, Reggie, Betty and Veronica, right?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Collectors&rsquo; Choice Music on July 18 will re-release four Andy Kim LPs via two loaded CDs: <em>How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way </em>mates with <em>Rainbow Ride</em> to document Kim&rsquo;s 1968-69 output, while <em>Baby I Love You</em> is conjoined with the eponymous <em>Andy Kim</em>. All albums except for <em>Andy Kim</em> (which was on Uni Records) were originally released on Steed Records, which was founded in 1967 by songwriter/producer Barry as a division of Jeff Barry Enterprises. Distribution was through Dot Records. It was another era, to be sure.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Andy Kim, the man with the magic pipes, was born Andre Youakim in Montreal and at age 16 arrived in New York, where he played a song for his Brill Building hero Jeff Barry. Thus began one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the late &lsquo;60s and early &lsquo;70s, which in turn led to Kim&rsquo;s hit singles and albums for Steed, which are widely regarded as the last, glorious gasp of the Brill Building sound.<!-- D(["mb","<br />\n <br />\nIn the spring of 1968,
