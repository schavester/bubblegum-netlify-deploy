<p>Not the Archies, but the Archies team (Jeff Barry and Andy Kim) at the peak of their musical creativity, with a two-fer reish of dreamboat vocalist/co-writer Kim&#8217;s first two albums for their indie Steed Records. After nearly a decade as producer and songwriter for hire for some of the most savvy guys in the business, Jeff Barry found himself with the muscle to bring projects to completion on his own. With these two albums, you&#8217;ve got the sound of pop&#8217;s finest craftsmen delighting in the formal structures of late sixties pop and forging two dozen lovely little moments. &#8220;HWEGTW&#8221; is more traditional Brill Building romanticism, with Barry&#8217;s trademark eclectic arrangements brimming with handclaps, steel drum and hushed, layered vocals. On &#8220;Rainbow Ride,&#8221; the pair are mildly psychedelicized, offering frenetic, organ-fueled rockers (&#8220;Please Be true&#8221;). Love You-era Stonesy rambles (&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s Ever Going Anywhere&#8221;) and with the gorgeous &#8220;Foundation of My Soul,&#8221; a reminder that, no matter what the hippie critics said, in the magical world of Kim and Barry, love, and pop, are not at all disposable.</p>

<p>On this dizzy 1969 release, West Coast jazzbo and his session cats work a breezy adult contemporary vibe, with giddy female vocal choirs manifesting the audio equivalent of a gaggle of happy stewardesses bearing fluffy pillows. The mellow, playful arrangements are applied to an appealing collection of bubblegum and pop-rock standards, including &#8220;Crystal Blue Persuasion,&#8221; the Sesame Street-popularized title track and &#8220;Sugar Sugar.&#8221; While the boy/girl singers are utterly out of their depth on the latter, it&#8217;s still a hoot to hear a dark narrative like &#8220;Ruby, Don&#8217;t Take Your Love To Town&#8221; handled so frothily. Silly, sweet mainstream fluff, presumably originally aimed at foxy grandpas, and still likely to please the comfy chair and fruity drink set. (Kim Cooper)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi. I&#8217;ve already shared most of this collection with you as part of &quot;The Riverdale Archives&quot;, but I recently discovered two more dances (&quot;The Angel&quot; and &quot;The Bubblegum&quot;) from my old VHS tapes. I think there are still more out there, but this gave me 19 tracks, enough to warrant a separate collection focusing just on the dance numbers. In case you&#8217;re not familiar with these, they&#8217;re all unreleased and taken directly from videotapes of the first season cartoons. When &quot;The Archie Show&quot; debuted on CBS-TV in 1968, the music was a big part of the show&#8217;s draw. Not only did the half-hour series feature the best stories of the entire Filmation/Archie run (very similar to the old comic book plotlines), it also gave us one of the finest bubblegum bands on the planet. Kirshner Records&#8217; Archies albums are some of the best pop records ever recorded. Don Kirshner did have a golden ear, and it heard a golden voice in singer Ron Dante. Ron&#8217;s voice shines like the sun itself on a brilliant catalog that gave us four top 40 hits and five studio albums. The only reason that I don&#8217;t share the albums is out of respect and love for Ron, who is one of the nicest guys in show business. I don&#8217;t want to curtail one thin dime from him, as he and Kirshner do plan to release a box set at some point. These TV-only tracks will probably never be released, so I don&#8217;t mind sharing them. The &quot;Dance-of-the-Week&quot; segments were used in the first season only to lead into a track from the first album. They were terrific little numbers that featured the Archie gang performing an animated version of the dance steps while the music played. The voice that introduces the dances is Dallas McKennon, Archie&#8217;s TV speaking voice. The songs themeselves are performed by Ron Dante and the crack musicians from the albums (including Jeff Barry and Toni Wine!) These dance numbers bring back such fantastic memories of that awesome first season that made The Archies rock stars! I am currently sharing mp3&#8217;s of the following Dance-of-the-week numbers at my blog,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/">http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/</a>&nbsp; Enjoy! TRACK LISTING: 01. DANCE-OF-THE-WEEK INTRODUCTION, 02. THE STICKSHIFT, 03. THE ANGEL, 04. THE BUBBLEGUM, 05. THE ROCKETSHIP, 06. THE MILKSHAKE, 07. THE INDIAN, 08. THE JUGHEAD, 09. THE BEANIE, 10. THE BETTY, 11. THE GRUNDY, 12. THE SURFER, 13. THE WEATHERBEE, 14. THE HAMBURGER HOP, 15. THE BANANA SPLIT, 16. THE VERONICA WALK, 17. THE TOUCHDOWN, 18.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi. As a huge Archies fan and avid record collector, I set out to find as many tracks as I could that featured the golden pop voice of Ron Dante. Many of you may know that in addition to the wonderful Archies catalog, Ron was also the voice of &quot;Tracy&quot; by The Cufflinks. Well, his pop music history goes much further and deeper than that. While researching his career on the internet a few years ago, I stumbled into a website called &quot;Laura Pinto&#8217;s Ron Dante Fan Pages.&quot; This chick had written extensive articles on Dante, including a discography that blew me away! While I had found a few old singles at yard sales and flea markets, Laura had amassed a collection so thorough that she was providing the man himself with copies of his own lost songs! Well, after a few e-mail exchanges, Laura and I became friends and started to trade tracks and videos back and forth. While the CD that I&#8217;m offering at MONDO DADDYKIN does not give you everything from our collections, it is definitely the cream of the crop of the rarities. These 32 tracks are all compiled from Laura&#8217;s singles. She had me transfer them for her and Ron awhile back, and has graciously given me permission to post them. We tried to avoid songs that are available commercially or for download from Ron&#8217;s official site. Ron Dante&#8217;s work was often released under the name of a &quot;ghost group&quot; or a pseudonym. The CD starts with his very first record, Ronnie Dante&#8217;s &quot;Little Lollipop&quot; from 1963! Laura Pinto also runs several other awesome sites dedicated to bubblegum music and classic oldies, and contributes invaluable articles to the pop community on a regular basis. Laura, bless you for sharing your collection with us. Hopefully, this will give our readers a new appreciation of the pop giant that is Ron Dante. I am sharing mp3&#8217;s of many of these rarities at my blog,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/">http://www.mondodaddykin.blogspot.com/</a> Check it out!! daddykin</p>

<p>This press release just in:</p>
<p> <strong>ANDY KIM, CO-WRITER OF &ldquo;SUGAR SUGAR,&rdquo; IS SWEET ON COLLECTORS&rsquo; CHOICE MUSIC<br /> &nbsp;<br /> </strong><strong>Four albums by last of the Brill Building artists (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F2C8E4/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank"><em>How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way/Rainbow Ride</em></a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000F2C8EE/ref=nosim/bubblegumbook" target="_blank"><em>Baby I Love You/Andy Kim</em></a>) to be reissued on two CDs on July 18<br /> </strong> <br /> LOS ANGELES, Calif. &mdash; Andy Kim has sold millions of records, but most people are under the impression he sold mere hundreds of thousands. The reason is simple. Although Kim had many hits under his own name (&ldquo;How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way,&rdquo; &ldquo;Baby I Love You,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rock Me Gently&rdquo; and &ldquo;So Good Together,&rdquo; to name a few), he co-wrote (with Jeff Barry) the Archies&rsquo; mega-hit &ldquo;Sugar Sugar,&rdquo; which sold 6 million 45 RPM units. Ron Dante provided the magic voice. Yet the fans never saw the scaffolding behind the scenes. The Archies, after all, consisted of Archie, Jughead, Reggie, Betty and Veronica, right?<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Collectors&rsquo; Choice Music on July 18 will re-release four Andy Kim LPs via two loaded CDs: <em>How&rsquo;d We Ever Get This Way </em>mates with <em>Rainbow Ride</em> to document Kim&rsquo;s 1968-69 output, while <em>Baby I Love You</em> is conjoined with the eponymous <em>Andy Kim</em>. All albums except for <em>Andy Kim</em> (which was on Uni Records) were originally released on Steed Records, which was founded in 1967 by songwriter/producer Barry as a division of Jeff Barry Enterprises. Distribution was through Dot Records. It was another era, to be sure.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Andy Kim, the man with the magic pipes, was born Andre Youakim in Montreal and at age 16 arrived in New York, where he played a song for his Brill Building hero Jeff Barry. Thus began one of the most successful songwriting partnerships of the late &lsquo;60s and early &lsquo;70s, which in turn led to Kim&rsquo;s hit singles and albums for Steed, which are widely regarded as the last, glorious gasp of the Brill Building sound.<!-- D(["mb","<br />\n <br />\nIn the spring of 1968,

interview by Don Charles</p>
<p>&#8220;Some songs, like &#8216;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&#8217; people hear and they get sad.  I think I&#8217;d rather have them get happy!  That&#8217;s really where I was coming from.&#8221;  That&#8217;s how songwriter/producer extraordinaire Jeff Barry sums up his musical philosophy, a philosophy that moved millions of dollars&#8217; worth of vinyl around the world during the 1960s.  Jeff Barry was the crown king of bubble gum rock producers (only Jerry Kasenetz and Jeff Katz&#8217; A &#038; R staff came close to challenging his dominance of the genre).</p>
<p>Jeff Barry:  I was born in Brooklyn.  When I was about seven, my parents got divorced, and I moved in with my mom and sister in Plainfield, New Jersey.  I lived there until I was eleven, and then we moved back to Brooklyn.  For some reason, I was hearing a lot of country music.  As long as I can remember, I&#8217;ve always loved horses, and probably without realizing it, I liked listening to country and western music because that went along with horses!</p>
<p>Don Charles:  My research indicates that your family name was Adelberg . . . </p>
<p>Jeff Barry:  Yes, that</p>
